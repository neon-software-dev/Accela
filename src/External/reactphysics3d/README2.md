This is an altered version of reactphysics3d 0.9.0. 

It was manually altered to fix unresolved type compile failures when 
compiling against newer C++ standards.

For reference, 0.10.0 causes yet to be resolved bugs with ray casting into
height-map collision shapes, and that's why 0.9.0 is still being used.
